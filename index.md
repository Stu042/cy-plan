# Cy, Syntax, Semantics, and Features

## Aim

Cy is a C like language - yes, yet another one. Its purpose is to provide easy to use, general purpose language that has built in multi-threading.
"Built in multi-threading" I hear you say, most languages do that, including C. Well they don't, they have libraries - often standard libraries - that provide the functionality to help with multi-threading. Cy on the other hand has it built in at the lowest level. The aim is to make multi-threaded coding so easy and intuitive that we do it with little to no thinking, in a safe, fast and efficient manner.
